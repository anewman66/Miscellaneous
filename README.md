# Miscellaneous
A miscellaneous bundle of scripts with limited or general use. 

I'll add some context for the scripts below when necessary. 

# SimpleIlluminaCovCalc.R

Sometime recently Illumina removed a really helpful coverage calculator tool from their support site. Technically it is still there, but it is now restricted to only kits which they sell and you cannot change all parameters. With some HTML editing I'm sure you could get it working again but I was in a rush so came up with an alternative calculator in R. I might re-write it in python also. 

This script is really basic and simple - I wrote it in a rush to get it working in line with a project deadline. I'll go back to this and tidy it up with a proper way of storing kit output sizes, displaying information, loops for the calculations, etc. But at the moment it works!

EDIT: I still mean to update this and turn it into a small python app...
